> Fish shell integrations for [asdf] version manager

[asdf]: https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf

This allows you to use asdf version manager for Fish in a set up managed by [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher). Instead of modifying your `config.fish`, use this plugin instead.

## Install

Install asdf version manager according to its instructions. As of v0.4.0, that is:

```bash
# NOTE: check https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf for updated installation instructions!
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.4.0
```

Using [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher), install the plugin:

```bash
fisher install rstacruz/fish-asdf
```
